In this article, we introduce a portable, low-cost impedance analyzer, referred to as 'Simple-Z,' which contains a signal processing unit that allows for a precise generation and reading of the excitation and response signals. Simple-Z is based on the integrated circuit AD5933 in conjunction with peripheral circuits for a fine output amplitude regulation, flexible response amplification, sampling rate control, automatic calibration, and external communication. Software solutions were implemented, including the strategical register overflow to allow decreasing frequency sweeps, the control of the number of acquisition cycles to reduce the spectral leakage of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the iterative approximation for defining proper response amplification and calibration resistances. The software also included a graphical user interface (GUI) with entries, buttons, and graphs that allow for an intuitive usage of the device. Results generated with Simple-Z in equivalent circuits mimicking sensing systems and in aqueous solution of different Na2SO4 concentrations were essentially identical to those obtained with a commercial benchtop impedance analyzer. Since the cost of the circuitry and components to fabricate an instrument is near U.S. 100 and because Simple-Z was designed to allow for easy upscale to mass production, one may expect it to be deployed in point-of-care diagnosis systems. Furthermore, it can also be used in teaching laboratories for training students in electrical impedance spectroscopy.},

The frequency generator allows an external complex impedance to be excited with a known frequency. The response signal from the impedance is sampled by the on-board ADC and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is processed by an on-board DSP engine. The DFT algorithm returns a real (R) and imaginary (I) data-word at each output frequency. Once calibrated, the magnitude of the impedance and relative phase of the impedance at each frequency point along the sweep is easily calculated. This is done off chip using the real and imaginary register contents, which can be read from the serial I 2 C interface. A similar device, also available from Analog Devices, Inc., is the AD5934, a 2.7 V to 5.5 V, 250 kSPS, 12-bit impedance converter, with an internal temperature sensor and is packaged in a 16-lead SSOP.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest cancer mortality rates, as it is often detected in late stages, when unresectable tumours are present. Researchers have identified a biomarker associated with the early detection of pancreatic cancer, called Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)---researchers have recommended it for pancreatic cancer screening, and for the monitoring of the efficacy of pancreatic cancer treatments. The development of a biosensor for the detection of CA19-9 is discussed in this paper. The biosensor uses capacitive spectroscopy on gold interdigitated electrodes. This electrochemical transducer mechanism was selected as appropriate due to its increased popularity in point-of-care applications. Mouse monoclonal anti-CA19-9 antibodies were covalently bound to the gold surface using cysteamine hydrochloride and glutaraldehyde, and immobilization was verified with a Zeiss AxioObserver fluorescence microscope. Next, the antigen was prepared in different concentrations, and added to the prepared electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy was carried out using the PalmSens4 Electrochemical Interface, where five different concentrations of CA19-9 were detected in this process. The concentrations ranged from 10 U/mL to 300 U/mL, which includes the threshold concentration of CA19-9 for the detection of pancreatic cancer, of 37 U/mL. This biosensor is, therefore, suited to detect the CA19-9 concentrations needed for pancreatic cancer screening.},

In this role, Bryan has been responsible for the marketing functions for TI's factory automation and control, test and measurement, medical and automotive ADCs. He joined TI in 2014 as part of the Precision ADC team after receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Arizona. Bryan became interested in the topic of ADC noise soon after joining the ADC team, seeing that many disparate questions seemed like they could be traced back to challenges with noise, precision and resolution. Specifically, he found many customers had difficulty understanding the relationship between noise and gain, as well as how that related to data-sheet performance. To explore this relationship further and provide insight to engineers, Bryan wrote and illustrated a three-part blog post series framed as a whodunit mystery. From there, he took a more technical approach and expanded this topic to include multiple noise sources and how they interact with precision ADCs. Bryan turned this content into an internal presentation to educate TI's sales team, followed by an online series of 12 articles, which TI assembled into this e-book.}

  abstract = {This report focuses on active low-pass filter design using operational amplifiers. Low-pass filters are commonly used to implement anti-aliasing filters in data acquisition systems. Design of second-order filters is the main topic of consideration. Filter tables are developed to simplify circuit design based on the idea of cascading lower-order stages to realize higher-order filters. The tables contain scaling factors (FSF) for the corner frequency (f c) and the required quality factor (Q) of each of the stages for the particular filter being designed. The tables enable designers to skip straight to calculating required circuit component values. To illustrate an actual circuit implementation, six circuits, separated into three types of filters (Bessel, Butterworth, and Chebyshev) and two filter configurations (Sallen-Key and Multiple Feedback), are simulated using a TLV9062 operational amplifier. Limiting factors in the high-frequency performance of the filters are also examined.}

CA 19-9 levels are frequently found to be elevated in individuals during general health examinations. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of such individuals and to determine the need for medical follow-up. Methods: We investigated individuals who underwent a health inspection, including a serum CA 19-9 test, at our center. Their CA 19-9 levels, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and personal and past histories were investigated. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed for those who underwent follow-up study for the elevated CA 19-9 levels. Results: Of 58,498 subjects, 581 (1.0\%) had elevated CA 19-9 levels. Multivariate analyses revealed that older age, female sex, lower BMI, and diabetes were independent predisposing factors for elevated CA 19-9 level. A subgroup analysis revealed that the causative conditions were identified in 129 of 351 subjects (36.8\%). Among them, the causative conditions in 31 subjects (8.8\%, including four cases of cancer and 15 of benign tumors) were not detected at the initial check-up and were found during the follow-up period. Conclusion: The use of CA 19-9 as a marker for cancer in healthy individuals is inappropriate. However, medical follow-up in individuals with elevated CA 19-9 levels may be useful because some causative diseases may be detected during follow-up.},

An equivalent electric circuit for a QCM is used to model the conductance and susceptance data captured by the analyzer.

Given that field effect transistors act as intrinsically signal amplifiers, even a small change of a chemical or biological quantity may significantly alter the output electronic signal. In EGOFETs selectivity can be guaranteed by the immobilization of bioreceptors able to bind specifically a target analyte.

  abstract = {Immunosensing is an analytical method which utilizes highly specific molecular recognition by antibodies [1, 2]. Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, immunosensing is exploited not only in biological studies, but also in various fields such as medical diagnosis, food analysis, and environmental monitoring [3-7]. In highly sensitive detection systems, the antibodies are generally immobilized on the solid supports of the sensing platforms, and antigens are detected by monitoring the signals resulting from the binding between antibodies and antigens. Although antibodies can be easily immobilized on the solid supports via physical absorption or covalent coupling with their amino groups, their antigen-binding capability tends to be impaired in these cases due to the denaturation, random orientation, and steric hindrance of antibodies on the surface of the solid supports. Thus, diverse methods for the oriented immobilization of antibodies have been developed so far [8-10]. In particular, many approaches have been proposed with antibody-binding proteins such as Protein A and Protein G from staphylococcal and streptococcal bacteria, respectively. These proteins specifically bind to the Fc region of antibod-ies from many species, and the Fc region is not responsible for binding to the antigens; thus, by using these Fc-binding proteins, antibodies can be immobilized on the solid supports while still leaving the Fab region fully available for antigen detection. In these systems, Fc-binding proteins carrying tag sequences are immobilized on the surface of the sensing substrates; then, the antibodies are site-specifically captured on it. For instance, Fc-binding proteins carrying a gold-binding peptide [11] or multiple cysteine residues [12] were directly immobilized on the gold surface of SPR sensor chips, and the antibodies were successfully captured on them. Similarly, for capturing antibodies, the IgG-binding domains of Protein G fused to gluthathione S-transferase were immobilized on the gold surface modified with glutathione [13], and the synthetic IgG-binding domain (Z-domain) of Protein A carrying a His-tag was immobilized on the surface of a microtiter plate coated with the iminodiacetic acid-Ni 2+ complex [14]. In all cases, the performances of immunosensing were clearly enhanced in comparison with those in the systems with randomly oriented antibodies. The surface density of antibodies on solid supports is also a consideration for immunosensing; it needs to be high enough to attain good sensitivity. With this in mind, various methods with highly organized molecular architectures have been proposed for the immobilization of antibodies. For instance, detection systems with polymer brushes were reported to enhance the antibody-loading capacity, where the polymer chains were prepared on the solid substrates of sensing platforms via surface-initiated radical reactions, and the antibodies were then appended to the multiple binding sites existing in each polymer chain [15-19]. Immu-nosensing systems with polymer brushes were applied to the detection of diagnostic marker proteins such as tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} [15], thyroid stimulating hormone [16], and prostate-specific antigen [17]. In the approaches using the polymer brushes, units carrying hydrophilic functional groups can also be incorporated into polymer chains, which suppress non-specific protein absorption [18, 19]. Other approaches with highly organized molecular archi-tectures were also proposed, including those with biona-nocapsules incorporating the Z-domain of Protein A [20], poly(amidoamine)dendrimers immobilized on a self-assembled monolayer [21], and a protein assembly comprising the enzyme, its substrate protein, and the Z-domain of Protein A [22]. All of these approaches have unique properties suitable for immunosensing.},

  abstract = {Inexpensive, noninvasive immunoassays can be used to quickly detect disease in humans. Immunoassay sensitivity and specificity are decidedly dependent upon high-affinity, antigen-specific antibodies. Antibodies are produced biologically. As such, antibody quality and suitability for use in immunoassays cannot be readily determined or controlled by human intervention. However, the process through which high-quality antibodies can be obtained has been shortened and streamlined by use of genetic engineering and recombinant antibody techniques. Antibodies that traditionally take several months or more to produce when animals are used can now be developed in a few weeks as recombinant antibodies produced in bacteria, yeast, or other cell types. Typically most immunoassays use two or more antibodies or antibody fragments to detect antigens that are indicators of disease. However, a label-free biosensor, for example, a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) needs one antibody only. As such, the cost and time needed to design and develop an immunoassay can be substantially reduced if recombinant antibodies and biosensors are used rather than traditional antibody and assay (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, ELISA) methods. Unlike traditional antibodies, recombinant antibodies can be genetically engineered to self-assemble on biosensor surfaces, at high density, and correctly oriented to enhance antigen-binding activity and to increase assay sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Additionally, biosensor surface chemistry and physical and electronic properties can be modified to further increase immunoassay performance above and beyond that obtained by use of traditional methods. This review describes some of the techniques investigators have used to develop highly specific and sensitive, recombinant antibody-based biosensors for detection of antigens in simple or complex biological samples. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},
