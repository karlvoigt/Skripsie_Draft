\section{Background}

Biosensors are defined as devices that measures biological and chemical reactions through the use of a physical transducer 
mechanism which in turn generates signals porportional to the concentration of an analyte in a sample.\cite{bhallaIntroductionBiosensors2016} This allows for the detection of various biological elements such as biomarkers which can be used to monitor health conditions or diagnose diseases.

Designing a low-cost easy to use device to take readings from biosensors, would thus provide a valuable tool for the early screening of diseases such as cancer. 
\todo{Changing wording and goals to be focused on point of care screening rather than analysis/detection}

This would decrease the need for expensive labratory testing and allow for lower cost and more regular testing of patients using a point-of-care device.
Having a multiplexed device, able to take readings from multiple biosensors, would allow a single blood sample to be taken and multiple tests to be run on it with minimum involvement from a healthcare professional.

\section{Project Objectives}
This is a multifaceted project that aims to develop a low-cost, easy-to-use device for reading biosensors. The system design objectives for the device include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developing a circuit that allows a microcontroller to read a biosensor through the use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)\index{Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)}. 
    This entails conditioning the sinusoidal signal generated by a DAC and measuring the current response from the biosensor through an ADC.
    \item This measurement circuitry needs to be multiplexed to allow for multiple biosensors to be read in turn without the need for human intervention.
    \item The microcontroller should be able to filter and process the biosensor data to determine the concentration of the analyte in the sample.
    \item The device needs to be able to communicate these results in a clear and user-friendly manner. 
This will be done through the use of a LCD screen on the device as well as a web interface that can be accessed through a smartphone or computer.
    \item The device should be battery powered, low-cost and easy to use, thus allowing for widespread adoption and use in various environments.
\end{itemize}
