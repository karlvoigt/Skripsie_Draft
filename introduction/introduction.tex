\section{Background}

Biosensors are devices that measure biological and chemical reactions through physical transducer mechanisms, generating signals proportional to the concentration of an analyte in a sample \cite{bhallaIntroductionBiosensors2016}. This enables detection of biomarkers that can be used to monitor health conditions or diagnose diseases \cite{BiomarkersNationalInstitute}. Early disease screening using biosensors could provide significant healthcare benefits, particularly in resource-limited settings\cite{chuRecentAdvancesChallenges2021}.

Commercial impedance analysers for biosensing, such as the PalmSens4, offer exceptional technical capabilities but are prohibitively expensive (approximately R85 000) and require substantial technical expertise to interpret electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. This creates a significant barrier to adoption in \ac{POC} environments, particularly in rural clinics and community health facilities where specialized personnel and equipment may be unavailable \cite{pariharPointofcareBiosensorsInfectious}.

Designing a low-cost, easy-to-use device to perform impedance measurements on \acp{IDE}, developed through previous research at this institution, would provide a valuable tool for POC disease screening. By abstracting the complexity of EIS interpretation and presenting results in an intuitive format, such a device would enable healthcare workers without specialized training to identify patients requiring further testing or specialist referral \cite{pariharPointofcareBiosensorsInfectious}. Furthermore, a multiplexed system capable of measuring multiple \acp{IDE} from a single sample would improve efficiency and reduce the need for repeated sample collection, making screening more practical in high-volume \ac{POC} settings \cite{pariharPointofcareBiosensorsInfectious}.

\section{Project Objectives}

This project aims to develop a low-cost, user-friendly multiplexed impedance analyser for biosensing applications. The system design objectives include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing analogue frontend circuitry that enables microcontroller-based \ac{IDE} measurements using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), including excitation signal generation, voltage measurement, and current measurement stages.
    \item Implementing multiplexing capability to sequentially measure up to four \ac{IDE} without manual intervention.
    \item Designing and fabricating a \ac{PCB} that integrates all analogue and digital subsystems.
    \item Developing firmware for signal processing and impedance calculation.
    \item Creating an intuitive user interface that enables device operation across diverse point-of-care settings by \acp{HCW} without requiring external equipment or specialized knowledge.
    \item Ensuring the complete system is battery-powered, portable, and achieves a total cost under R4,500 to enable widespread adoption.
    \item Calibrating and validating the system against a commercial reference instrument (PalmSens4) using test cells and \ac{IDE} measurements.
\end{enumerate}
